# Ice Cream Factory



# DESCRIPTION

The ice cream factory projects is done in collaboration with ABB and MÃ¤ladalen University. The project was to

build a UI for an already existing simulation engine. The app is a .NET application.

We used WPF to develop the UI, as requested by the customer. The simulation engine has the possibility to

several types of modules, which all will visualized in the UI's simulation page. To get a snapshot of all the parameters in the current simulation, the user can switch to a raw data view.

The history will be logged in its own file, and the UI allows for downloading of previous (and  current)

simulations and allow the user to select these by date. 

 

# FEATURES

Live update of the UI 
A UI separated from the simulation enige
Logging and downloading of logging files
