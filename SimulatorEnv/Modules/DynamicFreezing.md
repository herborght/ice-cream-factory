# Dynamic Freezing Module
Prior to the start of this module there is a pre-freezing test done to ensure that the mix meets standards for bacterial growth, specific mix temperature and particle size in order to ensure the quality of the product. 

Liquid flavoring is also done before the freezing is done, where liquid flavors are added to the mix. 
This is a module that models a dynamic freezer. The mix is first frozen very quickly using liquid refrigerant. Afterwards, the mix is whipped with a dasher at a barrel rotation  speed of 150-200 rpm and scrapes the ice layers from the sides of the cylinder. 

The consistency of the ice cream is measured in overrun which is defined as the percentage increase in volume after the mix has been whipped and undergone dynamic freezing.
