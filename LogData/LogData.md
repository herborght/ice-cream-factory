# LogData


## Logging

This folder is only used for storing log files generated by SimulatorEnv/EventLogging.
There are currently 3 logging options that generate log files:
1. EventLog - Generates a log file that contains all simulation parameters and their values called SimulationEvents-yyyy-MM-ddTHHmmss.log, where the second half is a timestamp. This file is appended every execution cycle. The files are sent to ./EventLogData
2. SimpleLog - Generates/appends a simple csv file with the simulation parameters called SimulationState.log. This file is stored in ./SimpleLogData
3. AllLogs - Combines the first two logging options. Generates/appends SimulationState.log and generates a new SimulationEvents file.

Zipfile
1. Whenever you download the raw data, the relevant data is added to a zipfile and sent to ../ZippedLog
2. If you restart the simulation you have to delete the files in ../ZippedLog temporary because of naming conventions
